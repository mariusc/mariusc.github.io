=============

This is the repo for my middleman-powered website.
The sources are on the source branch. I used the middleman-deploy gem to publish the built files to the master branch, while still keeping the sources on another branch.

This site wouldn't exist without the following projects:

- [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com)
- [Clean Blog Theme](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/)
- [Middleman Deploy](https://github.com/karlfreeman/middleman-deploy)
- [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/)

Special credit goes to [Ash Furrow](http://www.ashfurrow.com), for open sourcing his website. After realising we use the same theme, I inspired mysef from his middleman setup.
