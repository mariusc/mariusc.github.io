My tools of the trade are Xcode, Zeplin, Charles and Carthage. I like to stay informed, so I take part in iOS conferences (I've been to <a href="http://2015.mceconf.com/" target="_about:blank">MCE 2015</a> and <a href="http://2016.nsspain.com/" target="_about:blank">NSSpain 2016</a> and I've talked at <a href="http://www.uamobile.org/"> UA Mobile 2017</a>). I also have experience in building and maintaining frameworks (see my activity on <a href="https://github.com/mariusc" target="_about:blank">GitHub</a>)</p> <p> I've worked on more than 30 apps that went live. Here are some of the apps where I was one of the main developers:</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=container> <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"> <div class=row> <h1> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/dk/app/e-boks-dk/id482926022?mt=8" target="_about:blank">e-Boks</a> </h1> <img src="img/portfolio/new/eboks.jpg" class=img-responsive /> <p>e-Boks is the way people in Denmark get their public mails (from state, finance, city hall, etc). This is probably the biggest app I&#x27;ve worked on so far, with the most users and the biggest impact. We always supported at least 3 different iOS versions, but also implemented the latest features offered by iOS (document import from other apps, 3D Touch, Touch ID, etc). <br/>The app was done in a team of 2 iOS developers. </p> <b>Technologies: </b>Swift, Alamofire, LocalAuthentication (Touch ID), UIDocumentPickerViewController, 3D Touch <br><br> <h1> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/dk/app/fitness-dk-everythingcounts/id1183040627?mt=8" target="_about:blank">fitness dk</a> </h1> <img src="img/portfolio/new/fdk.jpg" class=img-responsive /> <p>Fitness dk is a premium chain of gyms in Denmark. We built an app for them that tracks the users&#x27; activity and calorie consumption, allows them to book classes or add other users as their training friends to be able to book the same class together. <br/>I was the only iOS developer on this app. </p> <b>Technologies: </b>Swift, Urban Airship, HealthKit, CAReplicatorLayer, CADisplayLink, EventKit <br><br> <h1> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/dk/app/pensionstjek/id1163778303?l=da&mt=8" target="_about:blank">PensionsTjek</a> </h1> <img src="img/portfolio/new/pensionstjek.jpg" class=img-responsive /> <p>Danica Pension is the life insurance and pension company owned by Danske Bank, the biggest bank in Denmark. We built an app for their customers to be able to check their pension contributions and status on an iPhone. The app had some very custom design for some controllers that allowed the customers to increase or decrease their contributions. <br/>I was the only iOS developer on this app. </p> <b>Technologies: </b>Swift, Urban Airship, UIStackView, LocalAuthentication (Touch ID) <br><br> <h1> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/dk/app/naturtjek/id981559504?l=da&mt=8" target="_about:blank">NaturTjek</a> </h1> <img src="img/portfolio/new/naturtjek.jpg" class=img-responsive /> <p>NaturTjek is an app that encourages users to register observation of certain animal and plant species in Denmark. The users can take a picture of what they observe and register the place where they observed it. The app also works offline, and registrations made while offline wait in a queue until the user has an Internet connection again. <br/>I was the main iOS developer on this app, the team was made of 2 iOS developers. I only worked on the app previous to the 2.0 version. </p> <b>Technologies: </b>Swift, FacebookSDK, Alamofire, CoreLocation, Parse SDK, Reachability, GoogleMaps SDK <br><br> <h1> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/dk/app/min-brystkr-ft/id1113223309?mt=8" target="_about:blank">Min Brystkraeft</a> </h1> <img src="img/portfolio/new/brystkraeft.jpg" class=img-responsive /> <p>Min Brystkraeft is an app developed in 2015 and released in 2016 that helps cancer patients monitor their condition and evolution. The app featured a wiki where relevant information could be found, a mood evolution where the users could register their daily mood and see their evolution, and an appointments manager, where they could register their doctor appointments and be reminded about them. <br/>I was the only iOS developer on this app. </p> <b>Technologies: </b>Objective-C, Alamofire, UICollectionView with super custom layouts, UILocalNotification <br><br> <h1> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tattoodo-1-tattoo-community/id1057590314?mt=8" target="_about:blank">Tattoodo</a> </h1> <video autoplay loop width=700 height=461 name=Tattoodo src="img/portfolio/new/tattoodo.mov"></video> <p>Tattoodo is a social networking app for tatoo enthusiasts. After my colleagues implemented the 1.0 version of the app, I worked on a redesign and a whole new onboarding experience for the next update. <br/>I was not involved with the work on the 1.0 version, nor with the updates following this redesign. I was the only iOS developer working on those features. </p> <b>Technologies: </b>Swift, custom segues and transitions, RazzleDazzle <br><br> <h1> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iata-economics/id1111567152?mt=8" target="_about:blank">IATA Economics</a> </h1> <img src="img/portfolio/new/iata.jpg" class=img-responsive /> <p>The International Air Transport Association publish periodical reports and statistics on air transport. We build an app that would let anyone interested see the reports more easily on an iOS device. The app was initially built for the iPad, but in a subsequent update it was made to also work on the iPhone. <br/>I was the main iOS developer for this app. </p> <b>Technologies: </b>Swift, Alamofire, UICollectionView, Parse SDK <br><br> <h1> Horsebook </h1> <img src="img/portfolio/new/horsebook.jpg" class=img-responsive /> <p>Horsebook was a social network app for horse owners, that aimed to connect horse owners, riding clubs, vets and horse equipment shops. Some of the features of the app were Facebook integration, friend feed, user profile, horse profile, messaging between users, and a wiki with various information on horses. <br/>I was the main iOS developer on this app, the team was made of 2 iOS developers. </p> <b>Technologies: </b>Objective-C, FacebookSDK, AFNetworking, iBeacons, Parse SDK <br><br> <h1> Lowki </h1> <img src="img/portfolio/new/lowki.jpg" class=img-responsive /> <p>Like Instagram, but for music. Lowki was social network app, aimed to connect music lovers with each other. You could post what you listened to, become frieds with other people, like or comment on their posts, filter your friends feed by music genre, or explore what was posted on the network. <br/>I was the only iOS developer on this app. </p> <b>Technologies: </b>Objective-C, FacebookSDK, AFNetworking, AVFoundation, Parse SDK <br><br> <h1> MEC CaseViewer </h1> <img src="img/portfolio/new/mec.jpg" class=img-responsive /> <p>MEC CaseViewer was a Universal app, both for iPhone and iPad that helped MEC show some of their chosen case studies. The app displayed data it got from a web API and showed videos from YouTube. <br/>I was the only iOS developer on this app. </p> <b>Technologies: </b>Objective-C, AFNetworking, YouTube-Player-iOS-Helper <br><br> </div> </div> </div> <div class=container> <div class=row> <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"> <p>If you're really curious, <a href="/work.html">here</a> you can also find my small side-projects which never made it to the App Store.</p> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <footer> <div class=container> <div class=row> <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"> <ul class="list-inline text-center"> <li> <a href="http://twitter.com/marius_const" title=Twitter> <span class="fa-stack fa-lg"> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i> <i class="fa fa-twitter fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i> </span> </a> </li> <li> <a href="http://github.com/mariusc" title=GitHub> <span class="fa-stack fa-lg"> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i> <i class="fa fa-github fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i> </span> </a> </li> <li> <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/constantinescumarius" title=LinkedIn> <span class="fa-stack fa-lg"> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i> <i class="fa fa-linkedin fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i> </span> </a> </li> <li> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2912892/marius-constantinescu" title=GitHub> <span class="fa-stack fa-lg"> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i> <i class="fa fa-stack-overflow fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i> </span> </a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="/js/jquery.min.js?1550337436"></script> <script src="/js/bootstrap.min.js?1550337436"></script> <script src="/js/clean-blog.min.js?1550337436"></script> </body> </html>
