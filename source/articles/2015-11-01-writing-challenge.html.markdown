There’s this thing I found out about on Twitter that people call “*NaBloWriMo*”. It actually is a derived version of “*NaNoWriMo*”, which stands for National Novel Writing Month. Shortly, *NaNoWriMo* is a challenge where people have to write daily for one month, and in the end have a 50.000 words fictional novel. I didn’t know this exists, but I found of its other version, “*NaBloWriMo*” (ok, I’ve got to admit, I think this name sounds silly) from [Maxim Cramer](https://twitter.com/mennenia/status/660769278715633664). 

The rules I’ll follow during this challenge are:

* write every day
* publish at least one article per week

One article per week isn’t very much, but compared to my usual writing frequency, it’s a lot. And in the end, the goal of this is to create a habit for writing, not just to add 4 more articles to my blog. Because, as [Ash Furrow says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjjvnrqDjpM), sharing your knowledge makes you a better developer in the end.

Here’s to hoping I can finish the challenge🍷!
