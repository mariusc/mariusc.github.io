title: Why I didn't start playing around with Swift

So, as everybody probably knows, Apple launched Swift at WWDC, on June 2nd. Despite my initial perplexity (wasn't expecting that) and my further excitement, I still haven't written a line of Swift code, even though it's been almost 2 months since it was launched.

Yes, I won't be able to say that I was coding Swift since day 1. But I don't really care about that. I also haven't programmed in Objective C since the first day it was launched, and that never stopped me.

A lot of people were excited about closures. They're nice, true. I've worked in functional programming languages in University, so I kind of know what they are and how to deal with them. And I didn't quite miss them in Objective C so far. 

Many guys want to try it as soon as possible, so they have a word to say in the "upbringing" and the future of this language. I totally understand their point. But it's not the case for me: I trust other people will do a very good job at finding problems, opening radars, modelling the language and making sure it's going in the right direction. 

But after all, the truth is that Swift is still experimental. A language that is constantly changing every two weeks, with every new beta launched, is definitely not a language I would like to write production code in. Yes, it's nice to experiment with new technologies, I'm a big fan of that. But it's not the right time now to do that with Swift. At least, not for me. But my vacation should start soon, so who knows :D ?
