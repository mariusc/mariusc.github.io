   about: |+
     e-Boks is the way people in Denmark get their public mails (from state, finance, city hall, etc). This is probably the biggest app I've worked on so far, with the most users and the biggest impact. We always supported at least 3 different iOS versions, but also implemented the latest features offered by iOS (document import from other apps, 3D Touch, Touch ID, etc). 
     The app was done in a team of 2 iOS developers.
   technologies: Swift, Alamofire, LocalAuthentication (Touch ID), UIDocumentPickerViewController, 3D Touch
